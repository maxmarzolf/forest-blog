    <p>Up, up the long, delirious burning blue
        I’ve topped the wind-swept heights with easy grace
        Where never lark, or ever eagle flew –
        And, while with silent, lifting mind I’ve trod
        The high untrespassed sanctity of space,
        Put out my hand, and touched the face of God.</p>
